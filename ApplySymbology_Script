Title: ArcGIS Pro: Apply symbology to new layers

Background: I needed to copy data from multiple folders into a single new folder that an ArcGIS Pro 
      project would be connected to. To do this I manually copied the data layers for a given Map into 
      the new folder, added them to the given Map, and then manually applied the symbology of the 
      original data to the new data. Doing this for over 70 projects, each containing multiple Maps
      can take a long time. To speed it up, I decided to write a multi-part script. 
      
Prupose: To rename the original data layers (so as not to confuse the apply symbology function), and
      following manually adding in the new data layers, match the original and new data layers and 
      apply the original data layers symbology to the new data layers. Following this the original 
      data layers can be removed from the project.

NOTE: Only use Part I of the script first, then manually add new data layers to Map, 
      then use Part II of script to apply symbology changes to new data layers

### PART I ###
import arcpy

project = arcpy.mp.ArcGISProject('current')

MapX = project.listMaps('<name or partial name '*' of Map>')[0]                         #Obtains Map and assigns to MapX
Layers = MapX.listLayers()                                                              #List current data layers in MapX 
for l in Layers:
    l.name = l.name + '__OG'                                                            #Rename TOC layer names to include '__OG' at the end of original names


### PART II ###
Layers_ALL = MapX.listLayers()                                                          #Obtains new list of data layers in MapX (post-addition of new layers for new file locations)
Layers_New = []
for l in Layers_ALL:
    if arcpy.Describe(l).path == '<string filepath location of new data layers>':       #Per data layer, if data layer filepath is the same as the new filepath's location:
        Layers_New += MapX.listLayers(l)                                                #    add the data layer to the new layer list 'Layers_New'
for l in Layers_New: 
    print(l.name)

for l in Layers_New:
    for f in Layers:
        if l.name == f.name[:-4]:                                                       #If the new data layer has the same name as the original data layer:
            print(l.name, ' == ', f.name)
            arcpy.ApplySymbologyFromLayer_management(l,f)                               #    apply the symbology from the original layer to the new layer
