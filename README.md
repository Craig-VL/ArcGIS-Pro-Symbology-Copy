# ArcGIS-Pro-Symbology-Copy
Script obtains list of original data layers and creates a list of any new data layers added to ArcGIS Pro project. It then finds the matching original and new data layers and copies the symbology from the original to the new file layer. This is done by renaming the TOC original data layers' names to '<layer_name>__OG'.
